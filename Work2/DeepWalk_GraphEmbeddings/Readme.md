# DeepWalk Graph Embeddings

DeepWalk is a method for generating embeddings, or vector representations, of nodes in a graph. It is particularly effective for graphs with rich local structures, meaning nodes that are close to each other in the graph tend to be more similar to each other than nodes that are far apart.

The idea behind DeepWalk is to generate random walks on the graph and then use these walks to learn node embeddings through a language modeling task. Each random walk corresponds to a "sentence" and each node in the walk corresponds to a "word". The objective is to predict the context (i.e., the neighboring nodes) of a given node in the walk, given the other nodes in the walk as input. This is similar to the task of predicting the next word in a sentence given the previous words.

To generate the random walks, DeepWalk uses a technique called truncated random walks. Starting from a given node, the algorithm performs a random walk on the graph, visiting each node in the walk in turn. However, the walk is truncated after a fixed number of steps, meaning that the algorithm only considers a local neighborhood of each node. By generating many such walks starting from different nodes, DeepWalk is able to capture the local structure of the graph.

Once the random walks have been generated, DeepWalk applies a variant of the skip-gram algorithm, a popular technique for learning word embeddings in natural language processing. The skip-gram algorithm takes as input a sequence of words (in this case, nodes in the random walk) and tries to predict the context (i.e., the neighboring nodes) of each word. The key insight of DeepWalk is to treat the random walks as sentences and the nodes in the walks as words, and to apply the skip-gram algorithm to learn node embeddings.

The resulting embeddings capture the local structure of the graph, meaning that nodes that are close to each other in the graph tend to have similar embeddings. These embeddings can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction.

Overall, DeepWalk is a powerful method for learning embeddings of nodes in graphs with rich local structures, and has been shown to outperform other state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets.
