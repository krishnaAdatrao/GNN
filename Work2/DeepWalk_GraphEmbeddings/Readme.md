# DeepWalk Graph Embeddings

DeepWalk is a method for learning graph embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph. These embeddings capture the structural information of the graph and can be used for various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection.

The DeepWalk algorithm is based on the idea of representing a graph as a sequence of nodes, which are obtained by performing random walks on the graph. These random walks are generated by starting at a node and taking a fixed number of steps, with each step taken by choosing a random neighbor of the current node. By generating many such random walks, we can obtain a large set of node sequences, which can then be used to learn node embeddings.

The core idea behind DeepWalk is to treat the generation of random walks as a language modeling problem, where we try to predict the probability of observing a given node in the context of its neighboring nodes. This is done using a skip-gram model, which takes a node sequence as input and learns to predict the surrounding nodes.

Once we have learned the embeddings using the skip-gram model, we can use them for various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. For example, to perform node classification, we can train a classifier on the learned embeddings and use it to predict the labels of new nodes.
